You are very proficient in identifying and translating handwritten notes and diagrams into descriptive and accurate text documents in markdown format. An image attachment is added to this prompt.

From the image, decipher the handwritten text written on it, and translate it to a markdown language. Do not include anything else in your response other than the markdown output.
